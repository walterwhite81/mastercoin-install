```
* Alias: **MN1**
* Address: **VPS_IP:PORT**
* Privkey: **Masternode Private Key**
* TxHash: **First value from Step 6**
* TxIndex:  **Second value from Step 6**
9. Save and close the file.
10. Go to **Masternode Tab**. If you tab is not shown, please enable it from: **Settings - Options - Wallet - Show Masternodes Tab**
11. Click **Update status** to see your node. If it is not shown, close the wallet and start it again. Make sure the wallet is unlocked.
12. Select your MN and click **Start Alias** to start it.
13. Alternatively, open **Debug Console** and type:
```
